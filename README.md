From April 11 to June 15, I will be participating in a cybersecurity training program. This bootcamp is organized by Fundación Telefónica in collaboration with Telefónica Tech and Splunk, and starts with an introduction to basic Python skills.

Throughout these 10 weeks, I will acquire skills in areas such as cryptography, network security, secure development and protection, web security, vulnerabilities, computer forensics, malware and malicious code, OSINT techniques and metadata, and open source intelligence research, among others.

Personally, I have been looking forward to this course all year and it was my main motivation to join 42 Malaga. During this time, I have invested many hours, in fact, I am in the top of accumulated hours, and during the bootcamp period, I have attended every day.

Thanks to this bootcamp, I have gained a lot of knowledge in various areas of cybersecurity. Throughout the bootcamp I have increased my knowledge of Docker, which has allowed me to understand how to create and manage development environments efficiently. I have deepened my Python skills and now I consider myself an expert being able to develop whatever I set my mind to and I have learned to automate functions, improving my productivity and efficiency in developing security solutions.

I consider that this bootcamp I have significantly progressed the understanding of vulnerabilities and the different branches of cybersecurity, also I have done several projects with great colleagues, great in every way. Through different projects, I have gained hands-on experience in identifying and solving vulnerabilities in systems and networks, as well as malware analysis and the application of forensic techniques.

Overall, this bootcamp has been an enriching experience that has broadened my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. I look forward to applying what I have learned to future projects.
