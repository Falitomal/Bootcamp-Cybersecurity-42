# Bootcamp Cybersecurity 42
This repository contains the projects I did during the 2nd edition of the 42 Malaga Cybersecurity Bootcamp.

From April 11 to June 15, I will be participating in a cybersecurity training program. This bootcamp is organized by Fundación Telefónica in collaboration with Telefónica Tech and Splunk, and starts with an introduction to basic Python skills.

Throughout these 10 weeks, I will acquire skills in areas such as cryptography, network security, secure development and protection, web security, vulnerabilities, computer forensics, malware and malicious code, OSINT techniques and metadata, and open source intelligence research, among others.

Personally, I have been looking forward to this course all year and it was my main motivation to join 42 Malaga. During this time, I have invested many hours, in fact, I am in the top of accumulated hours, and during the bootcamp period, I have attended every day.
