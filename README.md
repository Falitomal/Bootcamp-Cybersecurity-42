From April 11 to June 15, I will be participating in a cybersecurity training program. This bootcamp is organized by Fundación Telefónica in collaboration with Telefónica Tech and Splunk, and starts with an introduction to basic Python skills.

Throughout these 10 weeks, I will acquire skills in areas such as cryptography, network security, secure development and protection, web security, vulnerabilities, computer forensics, malware and malicious code, OSINT techniques and metadata, and open source intelligence research, among others.

Personally, I have been looking forward to this course all year and it was my main motivation to join 42 Malaga. During this time, I have invested many hours, in fact, I am in the top of accumulated hours, and during the bootcamp period, I have attended every day.

Thanks to this bootcamp, I have gained a wealth of knowledge in various areas of cybersecurity. Throughout the program, I have had the opportunity to learn about Docker, which has allowed me to understand how to efficiently create and manage development environments. Additionally, I have deepened my skills in Python and learned to automate functions, enhancing my productivity and efficiency in developing security solutions.

One area in which I have experienced significant growth is in understanding vulnerabilities and the different branches of cybersecurity. Through practical exercises and case studies, I have gained hands-on experience in identifying and remedying vulnerabilities in systems and networks, as well as analyzing malware and applying forensic techniques.

Overall, this bootcamp has been an enriching experience that has expanded my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. I am excited to apply what I have learned to future projects and challenges in this fascinating field.
